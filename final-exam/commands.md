<your commands>
```

## Part B — Permissions, Special Bits & ACLs

```bash
# build the tree (shared dir + private file); set octal + symbolic modes
# demonstrate setgid + sticky on a dir you own; build/set the setuid binary

<your commands>
```

## Part C — Bash Scripting, PATH & Safe Scanning

## Part D — Race Condition & flock

## Part E — Backups & cron

```bash
# E1: run backup_project enough times that pruning happens (keep newest RETAIN_N)
# E2: per-user crontab, two entries (absolute paths):
#     recurring (CRON_INTERVAL) -> partE_automation/logs/cron_recurring.log
#     one-shot at TIMED        -> partE_automation/logs/cron_oneshot.log
# E3: backup_exam -> tar the final-exam folder to ~/exam-backups/final-exam-<ts>.tar.gz
#     crontab: run backup_exam on a short interval AND once at exactly 16:00 today
#     then: ls ~/exam-backups
# capture crontab -l + both logs + the ~/exam-backups listing into cron_report.txt
<your commands>
```
