## Task 1: Process Creation on Linux (fork + exec)

### Compilation & Execution

Screenshot of compiling and running `forkchild.c`:

### Process Tree

Screenshot of the parent-child process tree (using `ps --forest`, `pstree`, or `htop` tree view):

### Output

```
[Paste the content of result_forkchild.txt here]
```

### Questions

1. **What does `fork()` return to the parent? What does it return to the child?**

   > [Your answer]

2. **What happens if you remove the `waitpid()` call? Why might the output look different?**

   > [Your answer]

3. **What does `execlp()` do? Why don't we see "execlp failed" when it succeeds?**

   > [Your answer]

4. **Draw the process tree for your program (parent → child). Include PIDs from your output.**

   > [Your answer / diagram]

5. **Which command did you use to view the process tree (`ps --forest`, `pstree`, or `htop`)? What information does each column show?**

   > [Your answer]

### Questions

1. **What is the key difference between how Linux creates a process (`fork` + `exec`) and how Windows does it (`CreateProcess`)?**

   > [Your answer]

2. **What does `WaitForSingleObject()` do? What is its Linux equivalent?**

   > [Your answer]

3. **Why do we need to call `CloseHandle()` at the end? What happens if we don't?**

   > [Your answer]

4. **In Task Manager, what was the PID of your parent program and the PID of mspaint? Do they match your program's output?**

   > [Your answer]

5. **Compare the Processes tab (tree view) and the Details tab (PID/PPID columns). Which view makes it easier to understand the parent-child relationship? Why?**

   > [Your answer]

## Task 3: Shared Memory IPC

### Compilation & Execution

Screenshot of compiling and running `shm-producer` and `shm-consumer`:

![Task 3 - Compile & Run](screenshots/task3_compile_run.png)

### Output

```
[Paste the content of result-shm-ipc.txt here]
```

### Questions

1. **What does `shm_open()` do? How is it different from `open()`?**

   > [Your answer]

2. **What does `mmap()` do? Why is shared memory faster than other IPC methods?**

   > [Your answer]

3. **Why must the shared memory name match between producer and consumer?**

   > [Your answer]

4. **What does `shm_unlink()` do? What would happen if the consumer didn't call it?**

   > [Your answer]

5. **If the consumer runs before the producer, what happens? Try it and describe the error.**

   > [Your answer]

## Task 4: Message Queue IPC

### Compilation & Execution

Screenshot of compiling and running `sender` and `receiver`:

![Task 4 - Compile & Run](screenshots/task4_compile_run.png)

### Output

```
[Paste the content of result-mq-ipc.txt here]
```

### Questions

1. **How is a message queue different from shared memory? When would you use one over the other?**

   > [Your answer]

2. **Why does the queue name in `common.h` need to start with `/`?**

   > [Your answer]

3. **What does `mq_unlink()` do? What happens if neither the sender nor receiver calls it?**

   > [Your answer]

4. **What happens if you run the receiver before the sender?**

   > [Your answer]

5. **Can multiple senders send to the same queue? Can multiple receivers read from the same queue?**

   > [Your answer]

## Reflection

What did you learn from this activity? What was the most interesting difference between Linux and Windows process creation? Which IPC method do you prefer and why?
